/**
 * important for search 
 * also called prefix tree
 * Name tries came from retrival
 * main application of this data structure is fast and efficient retrival of strings based on prefixes
 * typically we represent each character of a string as trie node 
 * also very memory efficient data structure
 * 70% uses cases around strings 30% about bits and other things
 * when you see strings and prefixes try thing about tries
